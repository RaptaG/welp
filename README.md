# welp
This simple bash script searches quickly for you commands you don't know their function. DuckDuckGo is used as the search engine, for efficiency and privacy! It works on both Linux _and_ MacOS! (right?)

## Installation
Open a terminal and run the following command:
```
curl -Os https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaptaG/welp/main/installer.sh && chmod +x installer.sh
```

After this is done, run the script with:

```
sudo ./installer.sh
```

## Usage
In a terminal, just run `welp` for the script to start. You will be asked the name of the command you want to search and the programming language.
